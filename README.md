# Movies

Write SQL queries to answer questions about a database of movies.

## Getting Started
Here’s how to download this problem into your own CS50 IDE. Log into [CS50 IDE](ide.cs50.io) and then, in a terminal window, execute each of the below.

* Execute `cd ~` (or simply `cd` with no arguments) to ensure that you’re in your home directory.
* Execute `mkdir pset7` to make (i.e., create) a directory called `pset7`.
* Execute `cd pset7` to change into (i.e., open) that directory.
* Execute `wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2020/fall/psets/7/movies/movies.zip` to download a (compressed) ZIP file with this problem’s distribution.
* Execute `unzip movies.zip` to uncompress that file.
* Execute `rm movies.zip` followed by `yes` or `y` to delete that ZIP file.
* Execute `ls`. You should see a directory called `movies`, which was inside of that ZIP file.
* Execute `cd movies` to change into that directory.
* Execute `ls`. You should see a `movies.db` file, and some empty `.sql` files as well.
